Currently we need some packages that do not exist in the ports tree or
need changes (patches, build settings). The Cookbook will disable the
normal FreeBSD-ports package repo to ensure only the one with the known
working packages is used. Treat this as an appliance, not simple
addition to your existing FreeBSD server. If you don't want to dedicate
a whole server/VM for this, run it all in a jail.

If you want to run in a FreeBSD jail you will need a fat/thick jail
instead of a thin jail as the Chef/CINC client does not obey hier(7) and
will attempt to write into readonly locations.

When running in a jail you will need to enable `allow.raw_sockets;` for
the Chatmail TURN server to work.

If you are not running in a VNET jail you should set
`ip6 = inherit;` or some other ip6 related value to ensure there is some
IPv6 configuration passed to the jail even if you do not intend to use
IPv6 as some socket binds will fail with an IPv4-only jail.

The FreeBSD chatmaild services (and all other services) are not running
under a supervisor so they could crash and not restart. This is not a
common issue, but it's one thing that systemd attempted to solve in the
Linux world. If we get reports that processes are crashing and failing
under load we will revisit this as we can change the services to run
under something like runit instead.

FreeBSD does not get the benefit of the Dovecot IMAP hibernation
functionality which can lower memory requirements for idle connections.

Debian mounts /tmp as tmpfs and OpenDKIM does use /tmp. There may be a
performance benefit to ensuring that your /tmp is mounted as a tmpfs.
